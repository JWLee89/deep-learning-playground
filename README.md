# Deep Learning Playground
An experimental playground where I get my hands dirty in order to practice and grow my skills in deep learning from the ground up.


## Current Work in Progress

Right now, I am current pre-occupied with my work as well as my masters degree. However, as part of my education, I am pushing myself to get well acquainted with deep learning techniques. I will try to write as much code as possible to become more familiar with key techniques, concepts and math.

## What to work on?

Below is the plan 

- Build a feedforward ANN with only numpy (including back-prop, derived cross-entropy, MSE). 
- Build the feedfoward ANN using tensorflow. 
- Build a CNN using tensorflow. 
- Build an RNN using tensorflow. 
- Build a LSTM cell using tensorflow. 
- Build a GCN using tensorflow. 

Afterwards, my challenge is also to do the following above using Pytorch. Anyway, that is the plan, but we will see. The order may vary depending on what I need to learn immediately in order to progress my research.


## GAN 

Below is a list of Generative Adversarial Networks that will be built along with a link to the assosciated paper.
